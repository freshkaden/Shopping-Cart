# Assignment 18 Online Shopping Cart

This is a simple java program that keeps tracks of a users shopping. It asks users for item name, quanity, and price, and stores that info in object item1. It does the same thing again and stores that info in object item2
After all the info is collected for the two objects, it outputs the info and calculates the subtotal for each of those items based on quanity. Theh it uses the subtotals to come up with the final complete total for all items and then outputs that to the user.

When program is run, it will ask user for desired character and height to use in the drawing. It will then output the specific right triangle and the height number entered will be how many lines the triangle will take up.
