# Assignment 18 Online Shopping Cart

This is a simple java program that runs on the command line and keeps track of a users shopping. It asks users for item name, quanity, and price, and stores that info in object item1. It does the same thing again and stores that info in object item2
After all the info is collected for the two objects, it outputs the info and calculates the subtotal for each of those items based on quanity. Then it uses the subtotals to come up with the final complete total for all items and then outputs that to the user.
